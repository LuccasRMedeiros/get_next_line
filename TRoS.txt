								The Realm of Souls

	In the year of 2046 a hacker had helped a Chinese corporation to create a 
revolutionary tecnology, that was batized as B.R.A.I.N, a "cristal ball" like which is 
capable to held informations from a organic brain and stablish communications between 
node-neurons in the same way a brain does. Such tecnology was been studied with the 
purpose of creating a digital heaven, a software running on a quantum computer 
interacting with the minds of the dead which ones were stored into on of those 
B.R.A.I.N's.

	Then the corporation (that now had what they needed to make their objectives became
true) did reported the hacker, and the hacker did desapeared. One year after, the Great
Civil War, or the Global Madness, or the Civilization Final Colapse or even "Capitalism
Self Destruction Program" had happened, making the concept of civilization desapear
with the many constructions of the mankind, the procuration on this hacker was been
forgot, and no one ever talked about this again.

	This hacker named himself "W0lrd_K1ng", and during the chaotic Bolsonaro's age, he
and his partners used to attack the dictator fake news network, communications of the
corrupt police officers, and blocking bank accounts of the major supporters of the
oppressive brazillian government. During those attacks, the crew gained so much power
through the internet, that in one day, cybersecurity researchers realized they took
control over all systems connected to the internet around the world, so a hunt to 
W0rld_K1ng, that never reached its objective, begun. The hackers did eliminated
the entire Bolsonaro family in 2024, what did Brazil be a weak target for the americans
who turned the country into a United States collony and posterly into a USA extension
in 2027, after this elimination, they just stoped all of his activities, and the
american government declared they were neutralized. 

	A convenient lie to make people feel more safer, a try to keep rebels distant from
gain popular support, and a strategy that showed promissory as the southern part 
extension never really protested against the lose of their identities.
